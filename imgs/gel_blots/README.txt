Validation was performed in two batches:

- First batch: RSZ22, RZ1A, UbiquitinE236 and TFB5 were validated. Because of the first batch nature
both controls (positive and negative) are included. 

- Second batch: DUF4050, MgProtoIXMethyl, HDT2 and CHMP1B were validated. Only negative control was included in order to check contamination, pcr artifacts ...
Positive control is no longer included because cDNA quality control and integrity  was checked in the first batch.

Some imgs were inverted in order to edit the final figure.
